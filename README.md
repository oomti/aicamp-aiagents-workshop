# Work in Progress - AI Development Workshop Series


## Overview
This repository contains a series of advanced workshops focused on building AI applications and agents. 
Each workshop provides hands-on experience with different aspects of AI development, from basic LLM interactions to complex agent architectures.

If you seek an introductory workshop, you can find further references [here](https://github.com/aicampg/aisg-7-day-aiimmersion/blob/main/README.md)

## Quick Setup

This workshop has been tuned to work with IDX, but should work with your custom development environment as well, after some edits.

You can start the workshop in a cloud environment, interacting through the browser

## Workshop Contents

### Day 1: Building Self-Reflective Agents with LangGraph
- Duration: 2.5-3 hours
- Topics:
  - Graph-based agent architecture
  - State management
  - Self-reflection loops
  - Data analysis integration
- Tech Stack:
  - LangGraph
  - LangChain
  - Python
  - Various LLM APIs

### Future Workshops (Coming Soon)
- Integration with vector databases
- Multi-agent systems
- Specialized use cases
- Advanced architectures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Access to LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)
- Development environment (IDX/Colab/local)

### Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-workshops.git
cd ai-workshops
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install base requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Workshop-Specific Setup
Each workshop directory contains:
- Dedicated README with specific instructions
- Requirements file for additional dependencies
- Setup guide for required APIs and services
- Jupyter notebooks with exercises

## Development Environments

### Recommended: Google IDX
- Cloud-based development
- Pre-configured environments
- Easy setup and collaboration

### Alternatives
1. **Local Environment**
   - Full control
   - Requires more setup
   - Good for customization

2. **Google Colab**
   - Free option
   - Limited resources
   - Good for learning
