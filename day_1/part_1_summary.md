# AI Agent Development Workshop - Part 1
## Foundation and Setup

### Overview
This workshop introduces fundamental concepts of building AI agents using Pydantic AI. Part 1 focuses on setting up the development environment and understanding core concepts.

### Workshop Goals
- Set up a development environment for AI agent creation
- Understand basic agent architecture
- Learn about different LLM providers and their characteristics
- Master basic agent interactions

### Key Components

#### 1. LLM Providers
Available providers with distinct strengths:
- **AI Studio (Google)**: Optimized for production deployments
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Strong in analysis and reasoning
- **OpenAI**: Well-rounded performance
- **DeepSeek**: Open source alternative

#### 2. Basic Agent Architecture
Essential components of an AI agent:
- **Model**: Core LLM interface
- **System Prompt**: Defines agent behavior and personality
- **Message History**: Maintains conversation context
- **Tools**: Extends agent capabilities

#### 3. Environment Management
Important aspects:
- API key security
- Environment persistence
- Cross-session configuration
- Provider-specific settings

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Message Flow
Understanding how information moves through the agent:
- User input processing
- Context management
- Response generation
- History tracking

#### 2. State Management
How agents maintain and use state:
- Conversation history
- Configuration persistence
- Context windows
- Memory management

#### 3. Basic Interactions
Fundamental interaction patterns:
- Simple queries
- Chained conversations
- Context-aware responses
- Basic tool usage

### Best Practices

#### 1. Security
- Never hardcode API keys
- Use environment variables
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate API responses

#### 2. Architecture
- Keep components modular
- Implement proper error handling
- Document code and functionality
- Follow type safety principles

#### 3. Development Flow
- Test incrementally
- Monitor API usage
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document behavior changes

### Common Pitfalls
1. Improper API key management
2. Ignoring provider-specific limitations
3. Not handling connection errors
4. Missing message history management

### Next Steps
After mastering these basics, you can:
1. Implement complex tool chains
2. Add structured output parsing
3. Create conversation memory systems
4. Build self-improving agents

### Resources
- Pydantic AI Documentation
- Provider-specific documentation
- API usage guidelines
- Community forums and discussions

### Workshop Progression
Part 1 sets the foundation for:
- Part 2: Advanced Agent Features
- Part 3: Complex Implementations
- Part 4: Production Deployment

This summary serves as a quick reference for the core concepts covered in Part 1 of the workshop. Refer to the notebook for detailed implementations and examples.
